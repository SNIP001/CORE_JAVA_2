/*       
Conversion of data from one type to another type is called type casting
Java Supports -> Primitive and [object or Reference] Type Casting
Casting can be implicit or explict
PRIMITIVE:
implicit casting happens automatically     [lower-> higher] [byte->int]
we need to write code for explicit type Casting   [higher ->lower]  [int->byte]
REFERENCE:
implicit type casting-> [child->parent] 
explicit type casting->[parent->child]
